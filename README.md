# 2021-NormalAnalytics
Need to support student engagement through the data resources currently available.
Whilst BB has a great amount of data which is currently broadly discarded in the background in unusable
formats.
The project proposes two elements:
1. Develop a processed dashboard of information useful for gauging
understanding and engagement of a unit at both a student by student level and also a cohort overview using
log on data, attainment in formative and summative tests and the analytics from videos.
2. If possible develop a tutor view where when given a list of students on a programme the software can
compile this data across units to again give personal tutors the information required to spot difficulties
for students and offer further support.‚Äù

Stakeholders:
- Personal tutors
- Current students
- Legal stakeholders (consured GDPR)

User Stories:
- As a personal tutor, I would like to be able to see student formative assignment data, not just the summative assignment data
- As a personal tutor, I would like to be able to see a the entirety of a student's academic data throughout all units, not just unit-by-unit
- As a personal tutor, I would like to be able to compare student assignment data to the general result of the cohort
- As a personal tutor, I would like access to data which provides context as to how many assignments students have been given for particular units
- As a personal tutor, I would to be able to see a student's average overall grade taking into account the different weightings of each unit
