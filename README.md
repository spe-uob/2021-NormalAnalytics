# 2021-NormalAnalytics
Need to support student engagement through the data resources currently available.
Whilst BB has a great amount of data which is currently broadly discarded in the background in unusable
formats.
The project proposes two elements:
1. Develop a processed dashboard of information useful for gauging
understanding and engagement of a unit at both a student by student level and also a cohort overview using
log on data, attainment in formative and summative tests and the analytics from videos.
2. If possible develop a tutor view where when given a list of students on a programme the software can
compile this data across units to again give personal tutors the information required to spot difficulties
for students and offer further support.‚Äù
