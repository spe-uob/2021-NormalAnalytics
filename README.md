# 2021-NormalAnalytics
Need to support student engagement through the data resources currently available.
Whilst BB has a great amount of data which is currently broadly discarded in the background in unusable
formats.
The project proposes two elements:
1. Develop a processed dashboard of information useful for gauging
understanding and engagement of a unit at both a student by student level and also a cohort overview using
log on data, attainment in formative and summative tests and the analytics from videos.
2. If possible develop a tutor view where when given a list of students on a programme the software can
compile this data across units to again give personal tutors the information required to spot difficulties
for students and offer further support.‚Äù

3. Enter your database and Redis server credentials in ./NormalAnalytics/src/main/resources/application.properties

4. Navigate to to ./NormalAnalytics and run the command 'mvn clean install'
